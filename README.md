# Transportations
It is a web application that I developed within one week for the Transportathon Hackathon competition.
# What is Transportathon Hackathon?
It is a competition organized by techcareer.net. The project's scope is to connect people in need of transportation from anywhere in the world with those who perform transportation services.
# Content
I developed the Transofast project using the Onion architecture with Asp.net technology and MVC Framework. I used Entity Framework Core with a Code-first approach for coding. MSSQL was used as the database. In this project, I designed it to accommodate three different types of users: User, Company Admin, and Employee. Users in the project can perform tasks such as creating Transportation Requests, viewing Company Information, communicating with Employees responsible for transportation, and evaluating transportation services.
